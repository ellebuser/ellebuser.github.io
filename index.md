## Hello! 
I am a 3rd year PhD student in Computational Mathematics at Emory University ([\<codes\>](https://www.math.emory.edu/site/codes/)) advised by Professor [Julianne Chung](https://www.math.emory.edu/~jmchung/).

My research interests are computational/Bayesian inverse problems, uncertainty quantification, and numerical linear algebra. 

See my CV [here](https:///ellebuser.github.io/documents/ElleBuser_CV_Jan2024.pdf).

### Current Projects   
  - Krylov subspace methods for large-scale hierarchical Bayesian inverse problems
  - Separable non-linear Bayesian inverse problems
  - Multimodal analysis of X-ray data (Argonne Nat. Lab)

### Upcoming!! 
  
  - N/A :(
